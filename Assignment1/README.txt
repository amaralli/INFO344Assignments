This project is a basic exploration of how to build and use LAMP Servers. 

Using a movie revenue data file, this program builds a database and incorporates that into a user-facing view
that showcases all of the movies and their various stats.

Users can also search through the list of movies, and even select a movie's title to learn more about it.

During this project, I used Digital Ocean to practice quickly deploying my work and also used
Vagrant to practice using and setting up a Linux VM before fully deploying.
